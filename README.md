This script is intended to manage the version of a project using the git flow branching model.
If you have a file in your project that keeps track of your apps version, but also have git keeping 
versions, tags and such. This script can help you by quickly modifying you version's file 
depending on the type of branch you are creating. You could even add a git hook!
